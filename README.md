# SQL Analysis - Retail Data

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates **advanced SQL techniques** for analyzing retail sales data.  
It simulates a modern analytics workflow using a **layered data architecture** and multiple analytical modules.

The project explores:

-  database exploration  
-  dimensional analysis  
-  cumulative metrics  
-  ranking and performance analysis  
-  segmentation  
-  customer analytics  
-  product analytics  

The goal is to transform **raw retail transaction data** into meaningful **business insights using SQL**.

# Data Architecture

This project follows a **Medallion Architecture** commonly used in modern data platforms.

### 🥉 Bronze Layer
Raw ingested data with minimal transformation.

### 🥈 Silver Layer
Cleaned, standardized, and structured datasets.

### 🥇 Gold Layer
Business-ready dimensional model used for analytics.

Tables in the **Gold Layer**:

-  `dim_customers`
-  `dim_products`
-  `fact_sales`

This layer supports **analytical queries, reporting, and KPI generation**.

---

# Analytical Modules

The `analysis` folder contains SQL modules focusing on different analytical perspectives.

### Database Exploration
Explores schema structure and table contents.

### Dimension Exploration
Analyzes categorical fields such as customers, products, and categories.

### Measures Exploration
Investigates key metrics like sales, quantity, and revenue.

### Magnitude Analysis
Quantifies the scale of business activity across business dimensions.

### Cumulative Analysis
Calculates running totals and moving averages for key metrics.

### Rank Analysis
Ranks products, customers, and categories based on performance.

### Part-to-Whole Analysis
Measures the percentage contribution of segments to overall totals.

### Data Segmentation
Groups customers and products into meaningful behavioral segments.

### Performance Analysis
Evaluates **Year-over-Year (YoY)** and **Month-over-Month (MoM)** business performance.

### Change Over Time Analysis
Analyzes trends, seasonality, and growth patterns in business activity.

# Reporting Views

Two analytical reporting views summarize business performance.

### Customer Report

Provides customer-level metrics including:

- total orders  
- total revenue  
- total quantity purchased  
- product diversity  
- customer lifespan  
- recency (months since last order)  
- average order value  
- average monthly spend  

---

### Product Report

Provides product-level performance metrics such as:

- total orders  
- total customers  
- total sales  
- total quantity sold  
- product lifespan  
- product recency  
- average selling price  
- average order revenue  
- average monthly revenue  

---

# Results

Generated reports are exported to the `results` folder:

- 📄 `customer_report.csv`
- 📄 `product_report.csv`

These files contain **aggregated analytical outputs** derived from SQL views.

---

# BI

- Generated a dashboard (.pbix file) usng PowerBI available in `powerBI` folder.

---

# Technologies Used

-  SQL Server  
-  T-SQL  
-  Dimensional Modeling  
-  Analytical SQL (Window Functions, Aggregations, CTEs)
-  PowerBI

---

# How to Run the Project

Run:

scripts/init_db.sql

### Build the data layers

Run:

scripts/bronze_01.sql  
scripts/silver_02.sql  
scripts/gold_03.sql  

### Run analytical queries

Execute SQL files inside the **analysis** directory.

### Generate reports

Run:

analysis/customer_report.sql  
analysis/product_report.sql
